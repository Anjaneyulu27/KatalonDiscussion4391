Testing React.js-powered WebUI with Katalon Studio
=====

## What is this repository?

This is a [Katalon Studio](https://www.katalon.com/) project for demonstration purpose.
You can clone this out onto you PC and execute it with your Katalon Stduio.

This demo project was developed using Katalon Studio version 5.4.2

This demo project was developed in the hope that it will respond to [an
issue in the Katalon Form: ["Does Katalon Studio support React.js Applications"](
https://forum.katalon.com/discussion/4391/does-katalon-studio-support-react-js-applications).

The original question was:
>Does katalon studio support react.js web applications?
Using selenium web driver we are finding it challenging to identify unique locators. Our application is built on react.js and was wondering if katalon studio supports react.js applications.

## About this demonstration

This katalon studio project executes a automated test against a React.js-powered application:

- https://react-table.js.org/#/story/simple-table

The test opens the URL in browser, find the table displayed, click a column labeled 'First name' to sort the rows, and tries to find expected data in the table.
